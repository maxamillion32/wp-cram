<p>Converts a fresh WordPress installation into a CRM with a built in Project &amp; Task Manager.  Originally this was built to help me manage my clients, projects and tasks however I felt that since originally, I wasn't successful in utilizing the existing CRM plugins for WordPress as sufficient tools for the task, I should share my Frankenstein with the world.  <strong><em>Enter WP CR[a]M</em></strong>  I hope that others find it just as useful and flexible as I have.</p>

<p><strong><em>As mentioned above, this was originally built for myself, therefore it's somewhat geared towards Web Development and/or Web Design, however, you can easily fork this and modify it to work for any business you'd like with a bit of code.</em></strong></p>

<h3>
<a name="usage" class="anchor" href="#usage"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Usage</h3>

<p>This plugin was developed to manage Web Development and Web Design Clients, though out of the box it can easily be used to handle a wider variety of client types wherein "projects" and "tasks" are required to fulfill a client's needs.  Out of the box it is still missing some <strong><em>user friendly</em></strong> features, which are listed at the bottom of this page under <strong><em>Future Features</em></strong>.  As it stands currently, WP CR[a]M is still a fully functional CRM and I use it daily as my own CRM to manage my clients and help me stay on task - though it will be significantly more [a]WESOME once I (or someone else) has the time to implement the Future Features listed below.  <em>hint hint =&gt; FORK IT &amp; CONTRIBUTE</em></p>

<p><strong><em>Screenshots Coming Soon</em></strong></p>

<h3>
<a name="important-notice" class="anchor" href="#important-notice"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>IMPORTANT NOTICE:</h3>

<p>It's important to note that <em>this plugin locks down wordpress for non-logged in users</em> as it stands and <em>should not be used on a public or production site</em>.  This plugin does not style any non-admin pages/posts relative to projects, tasks, clients, etc.  I would love to find the time to put together the code to create pre-built templates that injected the taxos and custom post types into the theme of the user's choice so that we can integrate customer communication and billing via WP CR[a]M - and I have plans to in the future - so if you would like to do so, feel free to <em>fork and pull</em> to your heart's desire!  And please do feel free to notify me of your mods in that direction (I will be adding my current WP CR[a]M task list in the future, time permitting).</p>

<h3>
<a name="credits" class="anchor" href="#credits"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>CREDITS:</h3>

<p>WP-CR[a]M uses two very sexy plugins in it's core.  Respect &amp; Credits go to the authors of these plugins.  Here is a list of the interior plugins that I used to save me countless hours in creating WP CR[a]M to make it function properly:</p>

<ul>
<li>MP6: Used for it's sexy WP Admin UI, until I have time to create my own</li>
    <li>Post 2 Post: Handles relationships between projects/tasks/clients/contacts</li>
</ul><p>In order to load these interior plugins correctly, their plugin headers have been removed.  If you have any questions about these plugins and how they function independently from WP-CR[a]M, please use the links above to contact the plugin developers.</p>
