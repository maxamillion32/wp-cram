{"name":"Wp-CR[a]M","tagline":"WordPress CRM","body":"# WP CR[a]M\r\nConverts a fresh WordPress installation into a CRM with a built in Project & Task Manager.  Originally this was built to help me manage my clients, projects and tasks however I felt that since originally, I wasn't successful in utilizing the existing CRM plugins for WordPress as sufficient tools for the task, I should share my Frankenstein with the world.  ***Enter WP CR[a]M***  I hope that others find it just as useful and flexible as I have.\r\n\r\n***As mentioned above, this was originally built for myself, therefore it's somewhat geared towards Web Development and/or Web Design, however, you can easily fork this and modify it to work for any business you'd like with a bit of code.***\r\n\r\n### Usage\r\nThis plugin was developed to manage Web Development and Web Design Clients, though out of the box it can easily be used to handle a wider variety of client types wherein \"projects\" and \"tasks\" are required to fulfill a client's needs.  Out of the box it is still missing some ***user friendly*** features, which are listed at the bottom of this page under ***Future Features***.  As it stands currently, WP CR[a]M is still a fully functional CRM and I use it daily as my own CRM to manage my clients and help me stay on task - though it will be significantly more [a]WESOME once I (or someone else) has the time to implement the Future Features listed below.  *hint hint => FORK IT & CONTRIBUTE*\r\n\r\n***Screenshots Coming Soon***\r\n\r\n## Notice & Credits\r\n###IMPORTANT NOTICE:\r\nIt's important to note that *this plugin locks down wordpress for non-logged in users* as it stands and *should not be used on a public or production site*.  This plugin does not style any non-admin pages/posts relative to projects, tasks, clients, etc.  I would love to find the time to put together the code to create pre-built templates that injected the taxos and custom post types into the theme of the user's choice so that we can integrate customer communication and billing via WP CR[a]M - and I have plans to in the future - so if you would like to do so, feel free to *fork and pull* to your heart's desire!  And please do feel free to notify me of your mods in that direction (I will be adding my current WP CR[a]M task list in the future, time permitting).\r\n\r\n###CREDITS:\r\nWP-CR[a]M uses two very sexy plugins in it's core.  Respect & Credits go to the authors of these plugins.  Here is a list of the interior plugins that I used to save me countless hours in creating WP CR[a]M to make it function properly:\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>MP6: Used for it's sexy WP Admin UI, until I have time to create my own</li>\r\n\t<li>Post 2 Post: Handles relationships between projects/tasks/clients/contacts</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\nIn order to load these interior plugins correctly, their plugin headers have been removed.  If you have any questions about these plugins and how they function independently from WP-CR[a]M, please use the links above to contact the plugin developers.\r\n\r\n#Current Features\r\n###Clients\r\n(CPT with custom taxonomies) *Not to be confused with **users**, clients can be companies or people*\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Clients come standard with some basic metaboxes for basic data fields such as contact information, social media profiles and client credentials.</li>\r\n\t<li>You can associate Clients to Client Statuses(taxo) There are 8 preset Client Statuses and you can easily create your own in the wp-admin area under `clients > client status > create new`\r\n\t\t<ul>\r\n\t\t\t<li>Active Client *Currently working with this client on REGULAR BASIS.*</li>\r\n\t\t\t<li>Average Client *This is an AVERAGE CLIENT that has projects/tasks at an average rate.*</li>\r\n\t\t\t<li>Freebie Client *self explanatory*</li>\r\n\t\t\t<li>Legacy Client *LONGSTANDING CLIENT that you have worked with for a long time.*</li>\r\n\t\t\t<li>Past Client *This is a client that you NO LONGER DO BUSINESS WITH.*</li>\r\n\t\t\t<li>Prospective Client *This is a POTENTIAL CLIENT and no projects or tasks have been started.*</li>\r\n\t\t\t<li>Referral Client *This is a client that REFERS OTHER CLIENTS TO YOU.*</li>\r\n\t\t\t<li>Referred Client *This is a client that WAS REFERRED TO YOU BY ANOTHER CLIENT.*</li>\r\n\t\t</ul>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>You can associate Clients to Client Contacts, Assigned Support Reps, Referred Clients and Referral Clients *these user roles are preset custom user roles with custom capabilities based on the role*</li>\r\n\t<li>You can assign a Client to a Client Type(taxo)\r\n\t\t<ul>\r\n\t\t\t<li>Client Types are *not preset* so that you can use terminologies that you prefer like \"design\", \"development\", \"seo\" or whatever your heart desires.</li>\r\n\t\t</ul>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>You can associate Clients to Projects</li>\r\n\t<li>You can associate Clients to Tasks</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n###Projects\r\n(CPT with custom taxonomies) *Quick Note: Projects are big, Tasks are small, Projects can be compiled with multiple Tasks.*\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Projects come standard with some basic metaboxes for collecing the standard project data such as start date, deadline date, project scope, project credentials, total hours and hours billed</li>\r\n\t<li>Projects come standard with basic preset Project Statuses (taxo)\r\n\t\t<ul>\r\n\t\t\t<li>Active Project *This is an active project, currently IN PROGRESS.*</li>\r\n\t\t\t<li>Client Reviewing Project *This project is currently being REVIEWED BY CLIENT.*</li>\r\n\t\t\t<li>Internal Project Review *This project is currently being REVIEWED INTERNALLY.*</li>\r\n\t\t\t<li>Pending Project *This project is currently INACTIVE AND PENDING.*</li>\r\n\t\t\t<li>Project Completed *This project has been reviewed and COMPLETED.
